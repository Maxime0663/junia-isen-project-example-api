# Shop App API on Azure cloud

This project demonstrates a simple application deployed on Azure using Terraform. Students will fork this repository to complete their assignments.

## Group Members

- Maxime BLOUIN
- Clément PETIT


## Project structure

- `api/`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `infrastructure/`: Contains the Terraform code to provision Azure infrastructure.
- `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.


## Remarks on the project:

We were unable to carry out the tests to verify the proper functioning of the entire project due to our Azure subscriptions, which stopped working (Clément: 3 days after the start of the project and Maxime: 2 days before the submission). The resources are therefore no longer active to showcase the work done. Moreover, as we were unable to find other members for this group despite multiple reminders on the course's Teams and the class Discord group, it was challenging for us to complete this project within the given timeframe while also working in a professional environment.
